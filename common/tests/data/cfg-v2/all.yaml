  # Map of the exported path.
  # Config v1 allows only one app per a flake. It does not
  # allow to export multiple commands and does not allow to have
  # different behaviours per a command.
  #
  # Config v2 solving this problem by having export path map
  # where internal flake command exports to an external command
  # on the host machine.
  #
  # Mandatory, should have at least one path defined
